# ToolBox
ToolBox is a open-source Java project created by wkgcass.
The project is aimed at enabling a simpler way of writing codes.
.
The repository is divided into 3 parts.

# source-code
As you may guess from name of the directory, it contains source code
and documents which javadoc generates.

# compiled-packages
This folder contains jar files, each of them represents a sub project.
There are usually some depending jars you may need to download if you
need to use these jars.

# compiled-packages-with-dependings
This folder contains jar files, each of them represents a sub project.
Different from 'compiled-packages', these jars contain all depending
jars/sources. Add the jar to project then you can start to use.
